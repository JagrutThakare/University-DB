Q2 a) What is tsunami? How it occurs.
ChatGPT
**Tsunami:**
A tsunami is a series of ocean waves with extremely long wavelengths and high energy, often caused by a large-scale disturbance of the ocean floor. Tsunamis can travel across entire ocean basins and, upon reaching coastal areas, they can cause devastating flooding and widespread destruction.

**How Tsunamis Occur:**
Tsunamis are typically triggered by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides beneath the ocean. The most common cause is an undersea earthquake, where tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface suddenly shift, displacing a large volume of water. This displacement generates a series of powerful waves that radiate outward from the epicenter of the earthquake.

The process can be broken down into several key steps:

1. **Underwater Earthquake or Volcanic Eruption:** When there is an abrupt movement of the Earth's crust beneath the ocean, it displaces a significant amount of water.

2. **Vertical Displacement of Seafloor:** The sudden vertical movement of the seafloor disturbs the water column above it, creating a series of waves.

3. **Formation of Tsunami Waves:** The waves generated by the disturbance are characterized by very long wavelengths and travel across the ocean at high speeds, often unnoticed by ships in deep water because their amplitude is relatively low.

4. **Approaching Coastal Areas:** As the tsunami waves reach shallower coastal areas, their speed decreases, but their energy becomes concentrated. This causes the waves to grow in height, potentially leading to a powerful surge of water onto the shore.

5. **Inundation:** The tsunami waves can inundate coastal areas with a series of waves, causing extensive flooding and damage.

Tsunamis can also be generated by underwater landslides or volcanic eruptions that displace water. Additionally, certain meteorite impacts or even large-scale underwater explosions have the potential to generate tsunamis, although these are less common causes. Early warning systems and community preparedness are critical for minimizing the loss of life and property associated with tsunamis.
